title: "Face Detection Algorithm"
description: "Face detection is a very important computer vision task.
Tremendous progresses have been made since deep learning,
particularly convolutional neural network (CNN), has been
used in this task. As the first step of many tasks, including
face recognition, verification, tracking, alignment, expression
analysis, face detection attracts many researches and developments in the academia and the industry."
